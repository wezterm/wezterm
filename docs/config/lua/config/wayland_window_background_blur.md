# wayland_window_background_blur = false

When combined with `window_background_opacity`, enables background blur
using the Wayland background effect protocol.

This can be used to produce a translucent window effect rather than
a crystal clear transparent window effect.

This effect can be achieved by adding the following to the configuration:
```lua
config.window_background_opacity = 0.4
config.wayland_window_background_blur = true
```

!!! note
    Wayland compositors may need to have blur enabled explicitely.
    e.g. on KDE Plasma, enable the _Blur_ plugin in _Window Effect_ settings.
