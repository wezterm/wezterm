# `quick_select_remove_styling = false`

{{since('nightly')}}

When set to `true`, all color and styling is removed from the pane prior to performing matching and highlighting any matching text in quick select mode.

This can make it easier to focus on the matches, particularly when the pane already had a lot of styling and colors.

Defaults to `false`
